Arduino Robot Sumo
------------------
*Written by Donagh Hatton and Cathal Coffey, [ donaghhatton (at) gmail.com ]*

General modular codebase for running Arduino based Robot Sumo robots using whatever configuration of sensors
and motors is preferred. Please let us know if you find it helpful!

ToDo:
- Documentation

Instructions:
- makefiles in the scripts folder are based off of the arduino-mk makefile (http://mjo.tc/atelier/2009/02/arduino-cli.html) 
- Use makefiles or Arduino IDE to build and upload, watch out for the EEPROM id flag!
